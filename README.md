## HTML:
**Structure:**

- The HTML provides the structure of your portfolio, defining sections such as the hero, education, skills, projects, and languages.
- The <section> tags help break the content into logical parts (e.g., Education, Skills, Projects), while the <div> elements hold and organize individual items like skill cards, project details, and language proficiency bars.

**Content:**

- Inside each section, you display your name, contact info, skills, education, projects, and language proficiency in a clear and accessible manner.
- Links are provided for contact, social media, and email, making it easy for potential employers or collaborators to get in touch.
  
**Space Background:**

- The <div class="space-background" id="space"> holds the background and contains dynamic elements like stars and floating diamonds, which are controlled via JavaScript and styled with CSS.
  
## CSS:
**Color Scheme:**

- The color palette, dominated by shades of purple (--primary and --accent), creates a modern and artistic feel. The gradient text effect on headers and subtitles adds to the visual appeal.
- The space background has a dark color (--secondary), which complements the vibrant purple elements, giving a sense of depth and contrast.
  
**Animations:**

- Twinkle Effect (Stars): The stars in the background twinkle with a fading effect, created using the @keyframes twinkle animation. This effect is applied to the .star elements in the space background, giving a subtle motion and making the background feel dynamic.
- Floating Diamonds: The diamonds float upwards with a gentle oscillation using the @keyframes float animation, creating a whimsical feel that ties into the space theme. Their positions are controlled by JavaScript, and they move in response to mouse movements.
- Fade-in and Parallax: Various elements (e.g., hero text, contact links, skill cards) fade in using the @keyframes fadeUp animation when they come into view, creating a smooth reveal effect. This makes the page feel more interactive and polished.
  
**Responsive Design:**

- The layout uses grid-template-columns to make the page responsive. As the screen size changes, the content (like education and skills cards) adjusts its layout automatically, making the page look good on all devices.
- The max-width and margin properties ensure content doesn't stretch too wide and stays centered on the screen.
  
## JavaScript:
**Starfield and Diamonds:**

- The createStars function generates 200 small stars that randomly appear at different positions within the #space div. Their size, duration, and position are randomized to make the starfield feel natural. The animation makes them "twinkle" by varying their opacity.
- The createDiamonds function generates 8 floating diamonds that move at different speeds and start their animations at different times. Their positions are also randomized, making them feel like they're part of the overall interactive space scene.
  
**Mouse Move Interaction (Parallax):**

- The mousemove event listener controls the parallax effect for the diamonds. As the user moves the mouse, the diamonds slightly rotate and translate based on the mouse's position on the screen. This creates the illusion of depth, making the page feel more immersive and interactive.
  
**Intersection Observer (Skill Cards Animation):**

- The IntersectionObserver watches when skill cards come into view on scroll. Once a skill card enters the viewport, it animates in with a delay based on its position in the DOM. This allows for smooth, staggered animations that improve user experience and add a sense of flow as users scroll through the page.
  
## How Everything Comes Together:
**Space Theme and Interactivity:**
- The space background is filled with stars and floating diamonds that create a cosmic atmosphere. These elements move and twinkle based on mouse movement and time, making the background dynamic.
  
**Color and Style:**
- The purple color theme is consistent throughout the page. The header and section titles use gradient text effects, and the background has a dark space-inspired color. The contrast between the dark background and bright purple elements makes the content pop.
  
**Smooth User Experience:**
- The animations (twinkling stars, floating diamonds, fading text, and scrolling skill cards) enhance the user experience by providing smooth transitions and visual interest. These effects are lightweight and non-distracting, keeping the focus on the content.
  
**Summary of User Interaction:**
- Parallax Effect: As the user moves the mouse, the diamonds react with a parallax effect, creating a feeling of depth.
  
- Scrolling Animation: As users scroll, skill cards and other sections appear with smooth animations, making the site feel responsive and interactive.
Dynamic Background: The space-themed background, filled with stars and diamonds, creates an immersive, artistic atmosphere.
